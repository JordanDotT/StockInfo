# Stock Information Retriever

This script uses yfinance to retrieve stock data and utilizes streamlit to visualize information on the entered stock.


## Description

This project is to explore interest in retrieving data using an API. I want to be able to 
eventually analyze and visualize data using python eventually
and this project will be my progress in doing so. In the future, there are plans
to use libraries such as NumPy and pandas.


## Getting Started
In order to run the program, you will need to install a few libraries.

##### Streamlit
https://streamlit.io/
<br /> Streamlit uses scripts to create a web application for data.
```
pip install streamlit
```

##### yfinance
https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/
<br /> yfinance acts as an alternative to Yahoo! finance's decommissioned API. yfinance allows us to retrieve historic market data.
```
pip install yfinance
```

## Help

To run the application run this command to host a streamlit app locally
```
streamlit run streamlit-application.py
```
